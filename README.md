# HTMX + PHP CRUD
## New Trends - why not to try it out.
(https://htmx.org/)
htmx gives you access to AJAX, CSS Transitions, WebSockets and Server Sent Events directly in HTML, using attributes.
So you can build modern user interfaces with the simplicity and power of hypertext
htmx is small (~14k min.gzâ€™d), dependency-free, extendable, IE11 compatible & has reduced code base sizes by 67% when compared with react.

How to start:
1. Create database test and table users (create code -> PDOConnection.php)
2. Start a simple PHP server (I use WAMP for development and testing)
3. That's it.

###  This is only the start. You should implement sessions, authentication, sanitize data, etc. Enjoy.
